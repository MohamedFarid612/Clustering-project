# Network Anomaly Detection

## Overview
The exponential growth of network traffic has led to an increase in network anomalies, such as cyber attacks, network failures, and hardware malfunctions. Network anomaly detection is a critical task for maintaining the security and stability of computer networks. The objective of this project is to implement clustering algorithms from scratch such as K-mean, Spectral Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN. All of those clustering algorithms can be used for network anomaly detection.
